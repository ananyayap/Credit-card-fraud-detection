This project uses the creditcard.csv dataset, which contains credit card transaction data from European cardholders. 
The dataset includes 500 transactions, with 17 fraudulent ones, making it imbalanced. The objective is to detect fraudulent transactions using anomaly detection techniques.
We implement and compare algorithms such as Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). 
The goal is to identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy despite the imbalanced nature of the dataset.
